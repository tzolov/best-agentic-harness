## Overview

The following advisors are included for demonstration purposes only. They help test and showcase the `BestAgenticHarnessAdvisor` evaluation harness.

## ChaosResponseAdvisor

Randomly corrupts LLM responses to test the evaluation harness. This advisor intentionally produces bad responses so you can observe how the judge detects and retries them.

<Warning>
  This advisor is for **testing only**. Do not use it in production.

## MyLoggingAdvisor

A simple request/response logger that prints the conversation messages to the console. Useful for observing the evaluation and retry flow in action.
