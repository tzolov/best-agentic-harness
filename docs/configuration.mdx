## Configuration Options

The `BestAgenticHarnessAdvisor` is configured via its builder:

```java
BestAgenticHarnessAdvisor.builder()
    .chatClientBuilder(judgeChatClientBuilder)
    .successRating(4)
    .maxRepeatAttempts(3)
    .build()
```

## Options Reference

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `chatClientBuilder` | **required** | `ChatClient.Builder` for the judge LLM that evaluates responses |
| `successRating` | `4` | Minimum rating (1–4) for a response to pass evaluation |
| `maxRepeatAttempts` | `3` | Maximum number of retries before returning the best available response |
| `promptTemplate` | built-in | Custom evaluation prompt template for the judge |
| `skipEvaluationPredicate` | skip tool calls | Predicate that determines when to skip evaluation entirely |

## Details

### chatClientBuilder

The judge LLM used to evaluate responses. This can be the same model as your primary LLM or a different one. Using a separate, potentially smaller model can reduce costs while still providing good evaluation quality.

### successRating

Controls how strict the evaluation is. Setting this to `3` instead of `4` will accept "mostly correct" responses without retrying for perfection.

### maxRepeatAttempts

Limits the number of retries to prevent infinite loops. After exhausting all attempts, the advisor returns the last response regardless of its rating.

### skipEvaluationPredicate

By default, the advisor skips evaluation when the response contains tool calls (since those are intermediate steps). You can provide a custom predicate to control this behavior.
