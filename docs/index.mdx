## What is Best Agentic Harness?

Best Agentic Harness provides a Spring AI advisor — `BestAgenticHarnessAdvisor` — that evaluates LLM responses using **point-wise scoring** and automatically retries failed attempts with feedback.

Inspired by [this LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424629895361740801/) on agentic evaluation patterns.

## Key Features

- **LLM-as-a-Judge** — Uses a separate LLM to evaluate response quality on a 1–4 scale
- **Automatic Retry** — Retries with evaluation feedback appended to the prompt when the rating is below threshold
- **Spring AI Native** — Integrates as a standard Spring AI advisor via `ChatClient`
